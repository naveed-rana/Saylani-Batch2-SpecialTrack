=========================
Build a Simple Realtime Todo Client App using the TDD Approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In this step, we made an app by using *Googleâ€™s Firebase Firestore Database*. Data will be stored permanantly to the database



Running the App:
--------------

  To run the server, first run the command *"npm install"* and after that run *"npm start".*<br />







Code Structure:
---------------
  a) _Save data to Firestore Database_<br />
      1) To save data to database, we  call *ADD* method provided by firestore.



  b) _Get data from Firestore Database_<br />
      1) To get data from NoSql database we call *GET* method provided firestore

  c) _Update Data on Firestore Database_<br />
      1) To update data on database, we call *SET* method proved by firestore


  d) _Delete a todo_<br />
      1) To delete a ToDo, we call *DELETE* method by firestore.
